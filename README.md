# Description
This project is a computer game application, it's a 2D shooter with database score storing functionality.
This was developed as a part of a University unit to demonstrate group work and software deployment.

# How to
All code is written in Visual Basic, to view the source code open _"Src>SEGame>SEGame.sln"_ in Visual Studio, 
or if you prefer, use your favourite editor to open the *.vb* files contained in the _"Src>SEGame>SEGame"_ directory.

If you want to just play the game then you can find the most recent build in the *build* directory.
Controls are WASD and mouse left click.
